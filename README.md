# Book List

A book list built to practice object oriented JavaScript. Built for Brad Traversy's [Modern JavaScript course](https://www.udemy.com/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/).

The project first used ES5 prototypical inheritence and was refactored to use ES6 classes.

It uses [Skeleton CSS](http://getskeleton.com/) for basic styling.
